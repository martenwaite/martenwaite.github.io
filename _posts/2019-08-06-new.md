# Marten Waite's new site

This morning I awoke in Santorini and I decided to start writing. 

I have not written in a long time and had thought I would never do any kind of writing again.

But suddenly as I went out onto my balcony—and I do mean that, there was nothing leading up to this decision whatsoever—I find myself having something to say. And I don't think I'm going to get much rest until I say it.
