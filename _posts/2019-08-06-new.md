# Marten Waite's new site


This morning I awoke in Santorini and I decided to start writing. 

I have not written in a long time and had thought I would never do any kind of writing again.

But suddenly as I went out onto my balcony, I found myself having something worth writing about.

My next essay will be the first in a long series of essays in which I will attempt to communicate the important things I have learned.
